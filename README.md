# FrontendMentor_React

### Qr-Component;
<p>First React Project!</p>
<p>Struggles That I have Faced in this Project</p>
<ol>
  <li> I couldn't understand the Errors that I have been facing</li>
  <ul>
     At beginning of the project, I tried to install materialUI Icons from NPM. But the Current version while I'm doing this project doesn't allow me to install. I got frustrated and searched through internet, after sometime maybe few hours I found the Reason.<br> **<b> Current Version -> 18.0.2 </b>** and the version that supports MaterialUI **<b>Needed Version -> 17.0.0 </b>**.
  </ul>
  <li>In this Second Project (advice-gen & advice-gen-react), the React does not renders anything.... searching for the problems.... :(</li>
</ol>
