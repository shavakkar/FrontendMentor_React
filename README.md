### Qr-Component;
<p>First React Project!</p>
<p>Struggles That I have Faced in this Project</p>
  1. I couldn't understand the Errors that I have been facing <br>

     - At beginning of the project, I tried to install materialUI Icons from NPM. But the Current version while I'm doing this project doesn't allow me to install. I got frustrated and searched through internet, after sometime maybe few hours I found the Reason. **Current Version -> 18.0.2 ** and the version that supports MaterialUI **Needed Version -> 17.0.0 **.
